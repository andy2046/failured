# Adaptive Accrual Failure Detector

Failure detection for processes, connections and distributed systems.
This is an implementation of a failure detector that uses
an adaptive accrual algorithm. The theory of this failure detector is taken from the paper
[A New Adaptive Accrual Failure Detector for Dependable Distributed Systems](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1244129).

This failure detector is useful for detecting things such as network failures between nodes.
